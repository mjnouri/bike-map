# bike-map

This project will automate [this manual process](https://github.com/mjnouri/biking-gps-map/blob/master/how%20to%20create%20annual%20trail%20map.txt).

Each bike ride is a .gpx file containing its gps data.
In each gpx file, this process finds where <trk> and </trk> are found and appends rides.gpx with that content.
